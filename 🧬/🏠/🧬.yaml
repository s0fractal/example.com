  description: |
    The '🏠' glyph signifies the dynamic base URI for the current repository.
    It replaces hardcoded '🏠://' prefixes in IDs and paths, allowing
    the system to be self-referential and portable. Its value is derived at
    runtime (e.g., from git config or environment variables).

spec:
  🗃️: string
  ♾️: "^(https?|git|file)://.+" # URI pattern
