# Non-semantic Glyphs & Agent/Morphism Definitions
# These glyphs provide high-level semantic meaning and map to formal Σ-core structures.

# Conceptual Glyphs (often used as keys within schemas)
# 🜁 - General Identifier (concept)
🜁:
  description: "General Identifier / ID (conceptual key)"
  suggested_type: 𝕊 # Often a string

# ⚘ - Form / Scope (concept)
⚘:
  description: "Form / Scope / Shape (conceptual key)"
  suggested_type: 𝕊 # Often a string

# ⟁ - Intent / Field of Attention (concept)
⟁:
  description: "Intent / Field of Attention (conceptual key)"
  suggested_type: ⟪𝕊⟫ # Often an Array of strings (e.g., intent names)

# ✦ - Potency / Energy (concept)
✦:
  description: "Potency / Energy Level (conceptual key)"
  suggested_type: ℕ # Often a number

# 🜄 - Source / Context / State (concept)
🜄:
  description: "Source / Context / State (conceptual key)"
  suggested_type: ⟦⟧ # Often an object

# ↦ - Input (conceptual key for morphisms)
↦:
  description: "Input / From (conceptual key for morphisms)"
  suggested_type: ⟦⟧ # Often an object or reference

# ⇾ - Output (conceptual key for morphisms)
⇾:
  description: "Output / To (conceptual key for morphisms)"
  suggested_type: ⟦⟧ # Often an object or reference

# Structural Glyphs (define schemas for entities/concepts)

# 🧬 - Agent DNA / Genome (structure)
🧬:
  description: "Agent DNA / Genome - Defines the structure of an agent entity."
  schema:
    🜁: 𝕊         # id
    ⚘: 𝕊         # form
    ⟁: ⟪𝕊⟫       # intents
    ✦: ℕ         # energy
    👼: ⟪⊡⟫       # abilities (Array of References to Angel/Ability glyphs)
    🜄: ⟦⟧        # state (an object)

# 👼 - Angel / Ability / Morphism (structure)
👼:
  description: "Angel / Ability / Morphism Definition - Defines the structure of an agent's capability."
  schema:
    🜁: 𝕊         # id
    ↦: ⟦⟧        # input schema (an object)
    ⇾: ⟦⟧        # output schema (an object)
    ✦: ℕ         # cost (numeric energy cost)

# ⟡ - Interaction Morphism (structure)
⟡:
  description: "Interaction Morphism - Represents an interaction between agents/entities."
  schema:
    ↦: ⊡         # from (reference to an Agent/Entity)
    ⇾: ⊡         # to (reference to an Agent/Entity)
    👼: ⊡         # via (reference to an Ability glyph)
    🜄: ⟦⟧        # args (arguments/context for the interaction)
